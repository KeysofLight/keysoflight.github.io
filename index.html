        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>My name is Jakub. I’m a pianist, a teacher, and a follower of Jesus. I’ve studied in Italy and the Czech Republic, performed across Europe and Asia, from jazz bars to concert halls – always chasing something deeper. Music is my craft. Christ is my reason. This platform exists to help you master the piano — and maybe, just maybe, find peace in the process. This is Keys of Light. Not just piano. A mission.</p>
