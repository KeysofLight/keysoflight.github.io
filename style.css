    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I'm Jakub, a concert pianist with a classical background from Czechia and Italy. After years of teaching and performing, I realized something was missing: light. Not stage lights, but divine light. Keys of Light is my mission to bring spiritual peace, deep beauty, and Christ-centered purpose into piano learning.</p>

    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>Most piano lessons are about pressure, technique and perfection. We're about peace, presence, and purpose. Learn with ease. Play with heart. Let the music become prayer.</p>
